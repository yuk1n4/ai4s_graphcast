# AI4S Models

A collection of **AI for Science (AI4S)** models. This directory hosts multiple, independent model repositories. Each model lives in its own subfolder and is self-contained, so that both **training** and **inference** work out of the box.

Every model must run training **and** inference on all six supported accelerator
families — NVIDIA, Huawei Ascend (华为昇腾), MetaX (沐曦), Hygon DCU (海光),
T-Head HanGuang (平头哥含光), and Moore Threads (摩尔线程). See the
[Multi-Platform User Guide](docs/multi-platform-guide.md) for detailed,
step-by-step setup and run instructions for each.

## Layout

## Conventions

Each model subfolder should be independently runnable and follow these guidelines:

1. **Self-contained** — keep code, configs, and dependency declarations inside the model's own folder. Avoid cross-model imports.
2. **Documented** — include a `README.md` covering the task, data, how to train, and how to run inference.
3. **Reproducible** — pin dependencies (`requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`, or `pyproject.toml`) and document the Python/CUDA versions used.
4. **Training-ready** — provide a clear training entry point and config, e.g. `scripts/train.sh` or `python -m src.train --config configs/train.yaml`.
5. **Inference-ready** — provide a clear inference entry point, e.g. `scripts/infer.sh` or `python -m src.infer --checkpoint <path>`.
6. **Weights & data** — keep large checkpoints and datasets out of git (use `.gitignore`); document where to download or how to regenerate them.
7. **Multi-platform** — the same codebase must run on all six accelerators. Take a
   `--device` argument (never hard-code `cuda`), keep an ONNX export path for the
   HanGuang inference target, and confirm every item in the acceptance checklist of
   the [Multi-Platform User Guide](docs/multi-platform-guide.md).

## Adding a New Model

```bash
# from within the ai4s/ directory
mkdir my-model
cd my-model
# add your code, configs, and a README.md following the conventions above
```

Then verify that a fresh checkout can both train and run inference before committing.
